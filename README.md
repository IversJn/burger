# Burger

### Overview
This program was designed to be burger logger. It accepts a burger from the user and the user is able to click the burger of their choosing and it will be marked as devoured and while at the same time the burgers are being tracked on a database.

### Requirments to run
To use this program please use: npm install, npm install express, npm express-handlebars

Set local port 8080

### Additional Notes for TA's
I couldn't get the burgers to switch spots but I got it to save in my database. After further research it looks like I have to use some sort of timestamp in my queries?

I originally tried to use the block code like the cats but it wasn't in the recommended files so I didn't use it. I can assume that the timestamp goes into the data fields for sql. I'm using my remainder of my time to figure out Heroku.
